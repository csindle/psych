I specialise in treating a range of mental illnesses, in adults, adolescents and children and have 10 years of experience as a mental health professional. 

I am a trained Clinical Psychologist who is registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). 

*Academic Background*
I completed my training in MA Clinical Psychology at University of Cape Town in 2017. Before this I was enrolled and completed a part-time MSc in Forensic Psychology and Criminal Investigation through the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. My Undergraduate and Honours degree in pscyhology were both also completed at the University of Cape Town.

*Work Experience*
I have lots of work experience and working with people from different cultures, backgrounds. Following my Honours degree in psychology I completed an internship in the United States in a Child Residential Psychiatric Treatment facility (PRTF), for a year. On my return to South Africa, I embarked on a Trauma Counselling internship, which lead to my registration with the HPCSA as a registered trauma counsellor. Following this I worked as a Trauma Counsellor at a government school in South Africa for 4 years before embarking on my Clinical Psychology training. 

After receiving my degree, I completed my internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. My time during this year was divided between Groote Schuur, Dr Abdurahman (a local community clinic), Valkenberg and Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. I then completed my Community Service at Brandvlei Correctional Centre, with my time divided between a medium secure facility and the youth Center. 

Currently I am working on a sessional (part-time) basis at the provincial hospital in Worcester and doing private practice work with the remainder of my time.
