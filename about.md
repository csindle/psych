I am a trained Clinical Psychologist who is registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA).
I treat a range of mental illnesses, in adults, adolescents and children and have more than 10 years of experience
as a mental health professional.

#### Academic Background

I completed my training in MA Clinical Psychology at University of Cape Town in 2017. Before this I was enrolled and
completed a part-time MSc in Forensic Psychology and Criminal Investigation through the University of
Liverpool in the United Kingdom. I completed both my Undergraduate and Honours degree in Psychology at
the University of Cape Town.

#### Work Experience

I have ample experience working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. Following my Honours degree in
psychology I completed an internship in the United States in a Child Residential Psychiatric Treatment facility (PRTF),
for a year. On my return to South Africa, I embarked on a Trauma Counselling internship, which lead to my registration
 with the HPCSA as a registered trauma counsellor. Following this I worked as a Trauma Counsellor at a government
  school in South Africa for 4 years before embarking on my Clinical Psychology training. 

After receiving my MA in Clinical Psychology degree, I completed my internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town.
During this year, my time was divided between Groote Schuur a tertiary Hospital, Dr Abdurahman a local community clinic,
Valkenberg a psychiatric hospital and Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. Following the successful completion
of this year I did my Community Service year at Brandvlei Correctional Center. During this year my time was divided
between a medium secure adult facility and the youth center. The youth center was working with young men between the ages of 17 and 25. 

Currently I am working in both the private and public sector. I am running a private practice in Worcester whilst also
working on a sessional basis at Worcester Provincial hospital.
