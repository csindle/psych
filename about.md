I am a trained Clinical Psychologist who is registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA),
and have more than 10 years of experience working with a range of mental illnesses and life challenges.


### Academic Background

I completed my MA Clinical Psychology training at the University of Cape Town in 2017.

Prior to this, I graduated with an MSc. in Forensic Psychology and Criminal Investigation from the University of
Liverpool, United Kingdom.

My Psychology undergraduate and honours degrees were completed at the University of Cape Town.  


#### Academic Awards/Scholarships

I have received the following awards:

* Oppenheimer Memorial Trust Scholarship (2016, and 2017) for students,
  with proven records of: academic excellence; and an interest in building the local South African community.
* MSc. distinction,
* Deanâ€™s Merit List at UCT (2008, and 2009),
* Golden Key Society membership for top academics.


### Work Experience

In 2010 in the United States, I interned at a Child Residential Psychiatric Treatment facility (PRTF) for a year,
which I found  to be very rewarding and educational.

Upon my return to South Africa, I completed my Trauma Counselling internship
to become a HPCSA registered Trauma Counsellor.

I then held this position at a government school in South Africa for 4 years
before embarking on my Clinical Psychology training.

My Clinical Psychology internship rotation in Cape Town included:
* Groote Schuur tertiary level hospital,
* Dr. Abdurahman Community Health Clinic,
* Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital, and
* the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital.


I completed my Community Service year at the Brandvlei Correctional Centre where I rotated 
between the medium secure adult facility, and the men's youth centre (for ages 17 to 25). 

Along with this private practice, I'm also working in the public sector at Worcester Provincial hospital.


### Special Interests

* Working with challenging behaviour,
* Understanding systems and their bi-directional impact,
* Mood Disorders,
* Anxiety Disorders,
* Trauma de-briefing/processing,
* Family, couple, and group work, and
* Screening and supporting people who suffer from severe mental disorders.
