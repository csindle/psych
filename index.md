### _"Life is hard, and sometimes we all need a little support and help along the way."_


I am here to provide a safe space for us to explore your internal world
so that you can get what you need and want from life.

I believe in working collaboratively, with me bringing my clinical experiences and academic knowledge,
and you sharing your unique life experiences and circumstances.

This method is based on the understanding that human behaviour is complex and we all come from our own
individual lived experiences of the world. Therefore your individual experience of the world needs to be considered and understood when developing an individual treatment plan.
