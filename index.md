As a Psychologist my aim is to provide a safe space in which we can embark on a journey together to help you get what you need/want from life. I believe in a collaborative approach to therapy, where you are the expert on your life and I bring my academic knowledge and clinical experience, and together we figure out the best way to apply our knowledge to you. This is based on the understanding that human behaviour is complex and we all come from our own individual lived experiences of the world, and therefore this needs to be considered and understood when developing an individual treatment plan.
