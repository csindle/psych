### Frequently Asked Questions

**How long is a therapy session?**

Session durations are usually 50 minutes, but it is a good idea to budget an hour 
for administration tasks and for us to find a good stopping point.  

**How much does a session cost?**

Sessions are charged at the prevailing medical aid rates. 

**How do I know what type of therapy I need?**

There are so many different types and approached to therapy that knowing exactly which one
best suits you is almost impossible. What is most important is that you have a goal or a
focus for therapy. From there together we can develop a plan that will best serve what you need.
If I am unable to provide you with exactly what you need, I will discuss with with you and make
a plant to refer you to an appropriate service provider.  

**Should I be anxious about starting therapy**

Whilst each person is different, some people are more anxious than others. It is very
understandable to be anxious, as you are embarking on a time of change. Additionally 
you are becoming vulnerable in from a someone who is a stranger. If you are anxious 
about this process, please do bring this to the first session as we can explore how
I can facilitate and make it feel more comfortable for you. It is also important
to remember that some anxiety helps facilitate growth and change so it is not
all bad, however it should not feel overwhelming.  

**Will you tell people about what we speak about**

I am bound by confidentiality, which means I cannot tell anyone what we speak about.
There are four exceptions to that rule 1) If you are in danger of hurting yourself 2)
If you are going to hurt someone else. 3) I am summonds by court 4) You give your
written/verbal consent. As a professional being able to maintain confidentiality
is one way in which I can create a safe space for you. It is therefore of utmost
importance that I protect our space as far as I possibly can, therefore if I am
required to break confidentiality for some reason I always try as best I can
to have a conversation with you first about it. 

**Do you offer online sessions?**

Yes, please let me know if this is your preferred way of receiving support.
