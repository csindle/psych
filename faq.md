### Frequently Asked Questions

**What duration is a therapy session?**

Session durations are usually 50 minutes, but please budget an hour 
for administration tasks and for us to find a good stopping point.  


**Do I need to know the type of therapy I require?**

No, I can help with exactly that.
There are many different approaches and types of therapy, and together we will develop a plan
that will best serve your needs.


**How much does a session cost?**

Sessions are charged at the prevailing medical aid rates. 


**Do you offer online sessions?**

Yes. Many people prefer this.  If you do (even temporarily), please let me know.


**Should I have reason, goal, or focus for the therapy?**

Yes, but this is often very difficult to define initially, so we can work together on this.


**Is it okay to be anxious when starting therapy?**

Yes, it is normal and very understandable to be anxious when embarking on the sometimes uncomfortable 
process necessary for growth and development.
If you are anxious about this, please mention it early on 
so that we can find a way to make it more comfortable for you.


**Are our sessions confidential?**

Yes, as stipulated by the Health Professions Council of South Africa.
