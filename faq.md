#### Frequently Asked Questions

**How much does a session cost?**

I charge medical aid rates. 

**How long is a therapy session?**

Sessions are usually 50 minutes, but it is a good idea to budget an hour for administration things and so we can find a good stopping point.  

**How do I know what type of therapy I need?**

There are so many different types and approached to therapy that knowing exactly which one best suits you is almost impossible. What is most important is that you have a goal or a focus for therapy. From there together we can develop a treatment plan and see what you need. If I am unable to provide you with what you require for whatever reason, I will make sure that I refer you to an appropriate and recommended service provider. 

**Should I be anxious about starting therapy**

Whilst each person is different, some people are anxious other are not. It is very understandable to be anxious, as you are embarking on a time of change. Additionally you are becoming vulnerable in from a someone who is a stranger. If you are anxious about this process, please do bring this to the first session as we can explore how I can facilitate and make it feel more comfortable for you. This being said some anxiety is also necessary to facilitate change, but it should not feel overwhelming. 

**Will you tell people about what we speak about**

I am bound by confidentiality, which means I cannot tell anyone what we speak about. There are four exceptions to that rule 1) If you are in danger of hurting yourself 2) If you are going to hurt someone else. 3) I am summonds by court 4) You give your written/verbal consent. As a professional being able to maintain confidentiality is one way in which I can create a safe space for you. It is therefore of utmost importance that I protect this as far as I possibly can. 

**Do you offer online sessions?**

Yes, please let me know if this is your preferred way of receiving support.
